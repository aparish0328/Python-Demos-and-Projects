# Python-Demos-and-Projects
This is a repository that contains some of the Python Programs that I made while studying Python at CNM, as well as a few that I made just for fun. 
The program "Fibonacci_calc.py" is just a simple calculator that takes user input to calculate the nth digit of the fibonacci sequence, up to the billionth digit.
The three files "car_db_init.py", "car_class.py" and "Car_DB_GUI.py" are all part of the same project. The last file starts a Graphical User Interface that allows the user 
to add, edit, and remove entries in a database that is created by the first two files. This database stores information on vehicles and their specifications, but these files 
can easily be modified to store whatever it is that the user desires. It would just take a different db_init file, removal or substatution of the class file, and some small changes would be made to the GUI to represent
the values that the user would be editing/entering/removing. 
This is what I turned in for the final project of my Intro to Python class.
Enjoy!
